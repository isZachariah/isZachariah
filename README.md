### Projects

+ unManageable

  -   An Android app developed using the Kotlin programming language and the Jetpack Compose UI framework, which is a modern, reactive framework for building native Android UI. I also integrated the Room persistence library to manage the data locally, it provided an abstraction layer over an SQLite database, which made it far more efficient and easier to query and sort the data. To handle concurrency, I utilized Kotlin's coroutines, and other modern features of the Kotlin standard library, such as KTX and LiveData, that helped me to create a responsive and stable application. The result was a smooth, user-friendly app that performed well and was easy to maintain.  
    
  -   Building on the success of the native app, I then rebuilt it for the web, leveraging my skills in TypeScript, React, and NextJS. I incorporated Server-Side Rendering to enhance performance and user experience. Using TailwindCSS, I developed a consistent design system. To serve the data to the client, I used the Prisma ORM as an abstraction layer over an SQLite database, which allowed for more efficient querying and data management and resulted in faster load times. I ensured type safety between the server and the client with Zod and TRPC, and by using TanstackQuery for caching and retrieving data, I made the app more reliable. 

+ [Scientific Calculator](https://iszachariah.github.io/scientific-calculator/)

  -   A web app that offers a seamless user experience by incorporating both a light and dark theme. To ensure accurate calculations, I implemented the Shunting Yard Algorithm to parse mathematical expressions into abstract syntax trees and Reverse Polish Notation to solve them. The calculator boasts various unary functions, binary operators, and easy-to-access constants and the ability to generate random floats or integers. Additionally, the app maintains a calculation history on screen, allowing users to easily retrieve and review previous equations and solutions. The result was a well-crafted, polished, and feature-rich web application.
