_I got a degree from the UW in studio art before finding programming. I realized that in computer science was everything I loved about art with the addition of UTILITY. I love learning and being challenged everyday and coding gives me that. I and am currently in school at WCC studying software engineering. I look forward to solving real world problems and working with other people._
